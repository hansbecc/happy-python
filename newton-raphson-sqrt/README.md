>It is a mathematic method to calculate the squarter root of a number:  
![](1.jpg)  

For example the number **27**:  
The close number for **27** is **25**, because **5x5=25** and **6x6=36**.  

So that ![](2.jpg)
```math
![](3.jpg)
![](4.jpg)
```
Now it is set to ![](5.jpg) for the next iteration:
```math
![](6.jpg)
![](7.jpg)
```

The result for this the ![](8.jpg)
